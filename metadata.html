			<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Newfoundland dogs were originally working dogs in Newfoundland <!-- create and ident paragraph with info -->
			used to pull nets for fishermen or drag wood. These dogs are extremely well swimmers and their
			sweet and lovable personality makes for a great family pet. 
			</p>
			
			<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Newfoundlands are a giant breed weighing around <!-- create and ident paragraph with info -->
			100 to 150 pounds once they are full-grown. However, a female typically ranges from
			around 100-120 pounds while a male weighs around 130-150 pounds. Although being
			a giant fluffy fur-ball doesn't sound bad, their size contributes to many serious 
			orthopedic problems and causes them to have a shorter lifespan of around 9-10 years.
			</p>
			
			<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A love to swim and be outdoors doesn't make <!-- create and ident paragraph with info -->
			Newfoundlands any less of a loyal and loving companion. Newfoundlands are eager
			to please and are highly trainable dogs. Whether you decide on a Newfoundland for
			their size, fluffiness, agility, or trainability, they are sure to make the 
			perfect pet!
