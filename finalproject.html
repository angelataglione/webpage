        	<p> <b> Marie Van Britton Brown </b> invented the home security system and <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/closed-circuit-television-CCTV" > closed circuit TV </a>. She filed a patent
        	for her invention in 1966 after being inspired from the security threat in her neighborhood. Being a nurse, 
        	Brown did not have normal work hours and the crime in her area posed a major risk to her safety. The police were
        	slow to respond to the violence, so she took the problem into her own hands. Brown's idea was to create a 
        	security system that would allow her to know who was at her house and quickly contact authorities. </p> <!-- create paragraph with link to closed circuit tv info and bold Marie's name -->

        	<p> In 1966, Brown invented a <a href="https://www.brickhousesecurity.com/security-cameras/cctv-primer/"> closed-circuit security system </a> that used a camera to recognize visitors and 
        	project the image on their television. Additionally, she created a panic button to contact police
        	immediately. This system was more complex than modern security systems, but was still effective. Peepholes
        	added to the complexity by using four peepholes at different heights with a camera placed over them to locate the visitor. Then,
        	a radio-controlled wireless system was used to transfer the camera image to the monitors. The monitors even 
        	allowed for a resident to respond to a visitor using a two-way microphone. Lastly, Brown used a remote control
        	to lock or unlock her door from a safe distance. </p> <!-- create paragraph with link to closed-circuit security system info -->
