		<p> You should travel to Teotihuacan, Mexico to see historic pyramids and beautiful 
		art murals! These pyramids are the largest urban center in the ancient world
		and influenced central Mexico as far south as Guatemala. The Reino Animal
		Zoo and Park is not far and offers a safari with a large variety of animals
		like giraffes, zebras, and camels. Also close by is a sky balloon ride over the
		city. A trip to Teotihuacan is definitely worth the trip to see these amazing 
		attractions and be close enough to possibly add on a trip to Mexico City that is 
		only 30 miles northeast! </p> <!-- paragraph about why you should visit -->
		<br/> <!-- make blank line -->
		<ul> <!-- creat unordered list -->
			<li> <b> Pyramids </b> </li> <!-- make pyramids bullet -->
				<ul> 
					<li> These pyramids stand tall at a height of 141 feet with a Talud-Tablero
					architectural style. The pyramid of the Sun is the largest pyramid in
					San Juan Teotihuacan, Mexico with the pyramid of the Moon in close second.
					The name Teotihuacan was given by the Aztecs and means "place where the
					gods were created". The population was estimated to have been around
					100,000 people consisting of apartment compounds. </li> <!-- intro to pyramids short bullet/paragraph -->
					<li> <b> Avenue of the Dead: </b> This is the city's main street that
					runs for more than 2 miles and contains three major pyramid complexes! <!-- intro to Avenue of Dead -->

					</figure></li>
					<li> <b> Pyramid of the Moon: </b> This pyramid is located on the 
					northern end of the site and was built in stages from 1 AD to 350 AD.
					The pyramid stands 150 feet high with elevated platforms thought to 
					have been used for rituals. Tombs found in the pyramid even contain
					human and animal sacrafices. <!-- pyramid of the moon intro and background bullet -->

					</figure></li>
					<li> <b> Pyramid of the Sun: </b> This pyramid is less than a half
					mile south from the Pyramid of the Moon and is one of the largest
					structures in the pre-Columbian New World. The pyramid of the Sun was
					completed around 200 AD, but it was not until 1971 that an archaeological
					team discovered a tunnel under the pyramid. They dug out the fill covering the 
					tunnel's entrance and discovered a cloverlead shaped chamber that was probably
					used for rituals. A year later, a small treasure of offerings was found that 
					dated back to when the pyramids were built. <!-- intro to pyramid of sun and background bullet-->

					<li> <b> Temple of the Feathered Serpent: </b> This pyramid is just south
					Pyramid of the Sun and was completed sometime in the 3rd century. Although 
					smaller than the others along the Avenue of the Dead, this pyramid has
					 many intricate details. </li> <!-- intro and background to Temple of Feathered Serpent bullet-->

			<li> <b> Reino Animal Zoo and Park </b> </li> <!-- Animal Zoo and Park bullet-->
				<ul> 
					<li> <b> Feeding the Animals: </b> The Zoo and Park even allows you to
					feed the animals out of your own hands! At the beginning you are
					allowed to feed small animals like sheep and calves without pay! Then,
					on the buses to the safari you can pay for food to feed large animals
					like gariffes and zebras. After this safari, you can board another closed
					bus to see lions and tigers. Although you can't directly feed this animals
					for obvious safety issues, the staff will put some chicken liver along
					edge of the bus so you can watch them eat right in front of you!

			certificate, after a 45 minute to hr flight depending on the wind and drop off 
			back at hotel in Mexico City. Worth every penny ! To do a balloon ride in Britain
			 over some old field is £99 each !this was breathtaking, the baloon basket is 
			 plit into 5 compartments, the middle is for the driver and the 4 corners each
			 old 2 people, so you have your own space. The driver aims and rotates the balloon 
			 so everyone gets the perfect picture they want without any pushing or shoving.
			 Perfect set up with no stress and gorgeous pics. Can't recommend enough !"</i> </blockquote> <!-- insert blockquote and italics -->
