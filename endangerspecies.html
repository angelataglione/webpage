	<h2> What is the Snub-nosed Monkey </h1> <!-- create title for info paragraph -->
		<p> The Snub-nosed Monkey, commonly scientifically referred to as the Rhinopithecus roxellana,
		is an endangered species found in Central and Southwest China. These golden-brown monkeys
		are known for their unique nose and blue tinted face. With the absence of nasal bones 
		and their nostrils upturned, Snub-nosed monkeys can withstand extreme cold of 
		their climate and frostbite. In addition to their facial qualities, Snub-nosed monkeys
		have different characteristics based on their gender. Males of the species are double
		the size of females; however, they both have long guard hairs and average life span 
		of twenty-three to twenty-six years old. </p>

	<h2> What is the Snub-nosed Monkey's Habitat/Diet? </h2> <!-- create heading for info paragraph -->
		<p> The Snub-nosed monkey's habitat is forests in the snowy mountains of Sichuan, Huebei,
		Gansu, and Shaanxi. Being the only primates in the area, Snub-nosed monkeys are
		constantly changing their diets due to climate changes. In the summer and spring,
		they are herbivores with a diet consisting of berries, fruits, and vines. On the 
		other hand, Snub-nosed monkeys change their diet to lichens, bark, 
		twigs, and insects during the scarce winter. If you want to spot a Snub-nosed monkey
		your best bet is in the sky as they spend most of their time in the trees swinging 
		up to three miles in search of food! </p>

	<h2> Conservation </h2> <!-- create conservation heading for paragraph -->
		<p> Sadly, Snub-nosed monkeys are endangered and at risk for extinction due to 
		their increased habitat loss and poaching. By the 1960s, the population began a sudden
		decrease and remains at less than 250 individuals today. Therefore, the Snub-Nosed Monkey Conservation
		Project was established in 1997 by Munster Zoo, the Zoological Society for the
		Conservation of Species and Populations, and the Westphalian Society for
		Conservation. These services provide data on animal populations and forest status. Since 2004, 
		these conservation tactics have been supervised by biologist Sonja Wolters. </p>
